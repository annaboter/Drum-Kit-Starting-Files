# Drum Kit

This project is a drum kit that allows users to play different drum sounds by pressing corresponding keys on their keyboard. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu.

## Technicalities

The drum kit consists of the following components:

- HTML: The structure of the drum kit is defined using HTML. It includes buttons for each drum sound and an audio element for each sound file.

- CSS: The drum kit is styled using CSS to make it visually appealing and responsive.

- JavaScript: The functionality of the drum kit is implemented using JavaScript. Event listeners are used to detect key presses and play the corresponding sound. The audio elements are dynamically created and manipulated using the Document Object Model (DOM).

## Purpose

The purpose of creating this drum kit is to get some good practice with JS event listeners and the DOM while having fun and making something interactive.
